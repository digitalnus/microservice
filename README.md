# 1.0 Overview

HSA is the approving authority for all healthy snacks distributed and sold in the country. All distributors and sellers must register and seek approval before they are allowed to distribute healthy snacks for the general public.

HSA is currently a system that has been running for over a decade, known as **PRIS** (Product Registration and Information System). 

Due to the growing demand and general population getting more health conscious, HSA is experiencing increasing transaction volume over the years and making changes to PRIS to meet the needs is getting much more difficult.

Senior management has decided to revamp the system and provide a better user experience and capability to meet the growing demands now and far into the future.

In designing the system, one of the key requirements is system architecture robustness and through the use of sound design patterns. The goal is to be able to react to any regulatory requirements by making changes to the relevant modules without affecting the others that we often see in a monolithic system.

One of the considerations is to explore the use of microservice in the new system.

The rest of this document will describe various microservice architecture and design patterns and explore how it can fit into one of the workflows in HSA.
